<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>

<p>One of my all-time favorites. A boy loses
    <br> everything to demons except his sister,
    <br> who is turning into one. He joins the
    <br> 
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Demon Slayer Corps</span> to save her and<br>
     fight back. Visually stunning and<br> emotionally powerful.</p>
<h3>The Notebook</h3>

<p>Noah, a poor man, falls in love with Allie
    <br> who comes from wealth. They are forced
    <br> to keep passion for each other aside due
    <br> to societal pressure and a difference in
    <br> the social stature of their families
</p>
<h3>Drive</h3>

<p>One of my top 3. A stuntman getaway driver
    <br> falls for a woman stuck in a criminal world
    <br> and risks everything to protect her. Gritty,
    <br> emotional, unforgettable.
