<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Zach Oliver — currently leveling up from 
  <br>“console.log(‘hello world’)” to full-stack wizardry.
</p>

<p>I break things (on purpose), Google a lot (it’s a skill),
  <br> and dream in code.
</p>

<p>Front-end, back-end… eventually, I’ll master all the ends.
  <br> Until then, I’m just trying not to crash the internet.
  <br> Let’s connect!
